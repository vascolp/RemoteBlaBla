# Changelog

## [1.00] - 2022-03-31
	- Big effort to squeeze all this stuff in CityHub short memory: succeded!
	- Reduced timeout value to 250ms
	- In configurations with more than two BLAModes, if motor is
	  spinning, double click in opposite direction can be used to stop
	  the motor. With two or one BLAModes, red buttons can be used to
	  do this, as it was in previous versions.
	- Added UpDown Modes: BLAUpDown100, BLAUpDown80, BLAUpDown60
	- Added modes based on motor speed: BLASpeedMotor,
	  BLAStepSpeedMotor, BLAVariMotor, BLAVariPressMotor
	- In Config mode, removing last configured mode is now done with
	  Shift-hub button.
	- Config mode reorganized so that Reverse Direction is specified
	  with Shift-Green. Removed all *Rev modes.
	- Fixed bug in Reverse Direction settings
## [0.99] - 2022-02-27
	- v0.99 update: new way of saving parameters: 6 ports support
	- Addition of 6 port support should allow usage on PrimeHub and
	  InventorHub, up to 4 modes with up to 6 ports. However, I haven't
	  got one to test it.
## [0.98] - 2021-12-12
	- First version of Remote Bla Bla and Remote City Bla released.
