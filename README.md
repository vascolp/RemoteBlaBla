# Remote Bla Bla

Remote Bla Bla is a Pybricks (https://pybricks.com) program for a LEGO
__PoweredUp TechnicHub__ and a __LEGO PoweredUp Remote Control__ where you
first define how each device answers to remote control button actions
(config mode) and then you play with your MOC/Set using the defined
configuration (play mode).

The configuration is saved so that you can turn off the hub, change
batteries if needed, go back to your hub and everything is there. Just
play. If the configuration is not what you want, you can go back to
config mode and reconfigure the behavior.

Keep in mind that this is a computer with an input device of 7 buttons
and an output device of just two LEDs. This is a Star Trek like
interface, a real YDSWIG interface: you don't see what you get.
However, once you learn it, you will notice that it is simple.
No screens attached!
